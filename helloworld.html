 <!--    The key parameter contains your application's API key. See Obtaining an API Key for more information. Note that this key is not the same key as used with the v2 API, and must be generated from the APIs console.

  The sensor parameter of the URL must be included, and indicates whether this application uses a sensor (such as a GPS locator) to determine the user's location. We've left this example as a variable set_to_true_or_false to emphasize that you must set this value to either true or false explicitly. -->
